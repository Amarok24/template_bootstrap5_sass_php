# template_bootstrap5_sass_php

An optimized starter template for Bootstrap 5.3 and Sass (SCSS), Composer (PHP)
is used as dependency manager for Bootstrap. A Sass compiler is not included, I
recommend [Dart Sass](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases), then you can
use both `sass_watch.sh` and `sass_compress.sh` shell scripts.

Demo: https://amarok24.github.io/template_bootstrap5_sass_php/

- Tested on different desktop browsers and on Google Android and Apple iOS
  devices
- Optimized for accesibility (page readers)
- Accessible via keyboard: use "ESC" to open the navigation, "TAB" to switch
  between sections, "ENTER" for action
- Optimized for fast loading
- [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)
  results: mobile 94%, desktop 99%
- Basic setup for switching between light/dark mode implemented

[GitHub](https://github.com/Amarok24/template-bootstrap-sass) which uses Bootrap
5.1 and NPM as package manager.
